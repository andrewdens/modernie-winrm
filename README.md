# modernie-winrm
This Vagrantfile is able to configure WinRM automatically on the box distributed by [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). In other words this Vagrantfile is able to:
* Disable firewall (the box distributed by Microsoft is configured with firewall enabled by default);
* Change Network location type to "Work network" (the box distributed by Microsoft is configured as "Public network" by default);
* Enable WinRM.

It was tested only Win10-Stable-MSEdge and Win7-IE11 box provided by [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/).
